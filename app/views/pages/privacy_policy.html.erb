    In general, we collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through Student IDeals. We also collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account. For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, email address and optionally your cell phone number. In the future, some of our services may require you to save a delivery or shipping address. When you create account information and use features of Student IDeals, we will collect information you provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of Student IDeals, such as your gender, year in school, facebook page and other information. We collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of Student IDeals, such as photos and posts you submit.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    We may also collect information about you and your friends who use Student IDeals from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. For instance, we may collect your user name or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through Student IDeals in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and connections, and to verify student identity as well.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    When you sign up for, or win, any contests, sweepstakes or other activities that we make available on Student IDeals, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include contact information such as your address and phone number.
  </p>


  <p>
    If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your e-mail address and other related information. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments or forums within the Student IDeals community.
  </p>


  <p>
    <b>Personal Information from Other Sources</b>
  </p>


  <p>
    We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered or interacted, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, “Partners”) or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.
  </p>


  <p>
    <b>E-mail and E-mail Addresses</b>

  <p>
    If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our “Feedback” form through Student IDeals, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide.

  <p>
    <b>Information Collected Via Technology </b>
  </p>


  <p>
    As you use Student IDeals, certain information may be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (“URLs”) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on Student IDeals you clicked. An Internet protocol address, or “IP Address,” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with Student IDeals. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. In order to use our services offered through Student IDeals, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of Student IDeals may not work properly, and you may not be able to receive our services. You can manage your cookie preferences via your browser settings (see <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a> for more information)</p>

    If you use mobile-enabled services provided by Student IDeals, such as any Student IDeals mobile application made available by us, we may receive information about your use of our services from your mobile device while you use our applications or services. This may also include information about your precise location if you have enabled location-based services on your mobile device. Certain applications or services may also require addition information collection, such as information to be sent when you are not logged into Student IDeals for alerts services, and the terms of such collection will be identified when you subscribe to or sign up for such services or applications.

    Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may provide your Personal Information to third-party service providers or affiliates who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of Student IDeals and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service.

We may share some or all of your Personal Information (other than credit card information) with Merchants whose Deals you have purchased for their commercial purposes and to provide the Deal. If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the manner identified in this Privacy Policy, you may not use Student IDeals. Certain promotions may expressly require you to submit information for fulfillment at the point of purchase, and Merchants may separately request information from you as necessary to redeem the promotion. A merchant’s collection and use of any information shall be governed by that Merchant’s own privacy policy. Additionally, we do share your content preferences and other information with social networks you have connected with Student IDeals, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information with.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="deals">IDeals</a></h3>

  <p></p>

  <p>
    Student IDeals provides consumers with information concerning deals and savings available to them in connection with the purchase products and services from third party merchants (“Merchants”) with requirements such as showing a valid ID or other engaging in activities such as checking in, clicking on a promotion, etc. (an “Ideal”). Merchants are willing to offer attractive promotions in order to reach the Student IDeals community. On our Site we list the IDeals offered by Merchants and details and restrictions that accompany them (expiration dates, etc.). We do our best to recommend standard ways of doing this and try to keep restrictions to a minimum, but ultimately the details are the requirements of the Merchants. Sometimes Merchants change their deals and restrictions without letting us know. And while we apologize for that inconvenience, in no way is the listing on Student IDeals any representation or warranty between you and Student IDeals or between you and the Merchant.

  <h3><a name="points">Points</a></h3>

  <p></p>

  <p>
    Our intention is to creat a point-based loyalty system that are a form of Student IDeals currency that may be applied as a credit towards future Student IDeals offerings. These are awarded based on different conditions, such as submitting photos, purchasing certain offers and taking other actions (responding to a promotion, etc.), or may be awarded to you from time to time as loyalty rewards or as customer service deems appropriate. Unless otherwise specified (such as with a promotion) points expire 3 years after issuance, except where such expiration is prohibited by law. Redemption possibilities may change from time to time and at given times certain points may not be usable at all. Points are not returnable or refundable for cash under any circumstances, except where required by law. Resale or transfer of points strictly prohibited, unless specifically authorized by Student IDeals.
